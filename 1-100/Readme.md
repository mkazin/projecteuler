- Problem 1: Classic FizBuzz. I decided to solve this the right way (rather than brute-force it), meaning manually using sums of series (and a calculator). So independently sum the 3s, the 5s and the 15s. Then add the 3s and 5s and subtract the 15s (because they get double-counted, being in both the 3s and 5s sets).
(add latex here...)
